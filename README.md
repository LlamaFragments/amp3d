Amersand 3D
===========

A game engine.

It doesn't really do a whole lot right now, but here's what I have planned for it:

- Entity-component system
- Lua scripting
- Some interesting effects?

The ultimate goal is to have some sort of editor GUI that's relatively easy to use,
and some way of "exporting" games.
